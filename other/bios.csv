Jessamine Chen,Jessamine-Chen.jpg,"Jessamine is a clinical psychologist and the Head of the Anxiety Treatment and Research Unit in the Department of Medical Psychology at Westmead Hospital. She has been practicing and conducting research in clinical psychology for over 10 years, specializing in the treatment of child and adult anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, and providing treatment in English and Mandarin. Her PhD research focuses on experimental investigation of cognitive biases in people with generalised anxiety disorder, specifically when they are faced with uncertain situations. Currently, she is also involved in a prospective study examining the long-term effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in a community outpatient setting."
Dr Bronwyn Graham ,Bronwyn-Graham.jpg,"Bronwyn is a Senior Lecturer and ARC Discovery Early Career Fellow. Her research focuses on the biological processes underlying the development and treatment of anxiety disorders, with the aim of developing ways of augmenting the effectiveness of current treatments by combining them with novel adjuncts that target these processes. She is particularly interested in the impact of female sex hormones like estrogen, given that women are twice as likely to develop anxiety disorders compared to men. Bronwyn and colleagues have recently completed a clinical trial of exposure therapy for spider phobia which showed that women respond much better to treatment, and show much greater sustained recovery from symptoms, when it is delivered during periods of heightened estrogen (e.g., ovulation). These findings could fundamentally transform the way that anxiety treatments are delivered to women, by routinely taking factors that affect hormonal status (like hormonal contraceptive use, menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause) into account."
Dr Jill Newby,Jill-Newby.jpg,"Jill is a Senior Lecturer and NHMRC/MRFF Career Development Fellow. Her research looks at how we can use the internet, smartphones, and virtual reality in the treatment of anxiety and depression. In this research project, she is testing whether we can use a brief one-session virtual reality exposure therapy intervention to treat phobias (e.g., heights, needles & blood). She is also conducting research to explore how we can improve access to psychological treatment by using the internet and smartphones to deliver therapy. Using this approach, we can help people access affordable, high quality mental health care, regardless of where they live, or their financial circumstances."

Dr Kelly Clemens,Kelly-Clemens.jpg,"Kelly is a Lecturer and current UNSW Scientia Fellow. She is trying to figure out why people can relapse to drug abuse after periods of abstinence. This includes looking at pharmacological and molecular changes in the brain that occur in response to drug exposure, and that can persist across abstinence."
Dr Lydia Hayward,Lydia-Hayward.jpg,"Lydia is a postdoctoral researcher whose work lies at the intersection of social and health psychology. Her research explores the causes and consequences of prejudice. She investigates how positive contact with people from stigmatized groups can reduce prejudice (i.e., racism, weight bias), and how negative contact may increase it. Her work also investigates how experiencing stigma is harmful for members of stigmatized groups. For example, people who are overweight or obese face frequent stigma and discrimination because of their weight, and this is associated with poorer psychological well-being and reduced motivation to engage in health behaviours like eating healthy and exercising."
Professor Skye McDonald,Skye-McDonald.jpg,Skye is a Professor of Neuropsychology at UNSW Sydney. She obtained a Masters in Clinical neuropsychology from the University of Melbourne in 1983 and a PhD from Macquarie University in 1992.

Currently, she is investigating whether experiences of humility can reduce anger and aggression."
Samantha Spanos,Samantha-Spanos.jpg,"Samantha is a PhD candidate at UNSW. Her research examines the attributions people make for their eating behaviour. She is interested in the ways in which people might be motivated to deny external influences on their food intake, and the affective and behavioral consequences associated with these motivated explanations. Exploring how people conceptualise their eating behaviour can help us understand the impact of self-evaluations on health and wellbeing."

Dr Rachel Stephens,Rachel-Stephens.jpg,"Rachel is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Sydney Thinking and Reasoning Lab at the University of New South Wales. Her research focuses on understanding the cognitive processes that underlie human reasoning and judgment. This is important given that people are increasingly asked to draw conclusions about complex issues, often based on conflicting evidence (e.g., how to make healthcare fit for the future, or how we should respond to climate change). One of her key goals is to advance the field’s quantitative and methodological approaches, helping to test competing theories more rigorously. An important part of her work has involved challenging long-standing and influential dual-process theories of reasoning, which distinguish between faster, intuitive thinking and slower, deliberate thinking. This has important implications for questions such as how reasoning skills develop in children, and how we might train and encourage ""better"" reasoning."
Dr Justine Fam,Justine-Fam.jpg,"Justine is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. Her current work focuses on the neural mechanisms underpinning Pavlovian conditioning and extinction. She obtained her PhD in Psychology from UNSW, where her thesis examined the temporal dynamics and behavioural correlates of decision-making. Justine hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory by pairing neuroscience techniques with detailed analyses of behaviour."
